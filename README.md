# hw04-Group11

Description: For this assignment, we start from the conclusion of HW02 and continue improving the structure of the repository as a Reproducible Research Package, using again the code from the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial. We also add a bit more structure, tests, documentation, and a [jupyter-book](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/hw04-Group11/), to complete the picture.
