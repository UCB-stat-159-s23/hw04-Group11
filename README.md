# hw04-Group11

Description: For this assignment, start from the conclusion of HW02 and continue improving the structure of the repository as a Reproducible Research Package, using again the code from the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial. And add a bit more structure, tests, documentation, etc, to complete the picture.
